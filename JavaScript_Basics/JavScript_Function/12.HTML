<!-- 12. Write a JavaScript function which says whether a number is perfect.  
According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer 
that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its 
positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). 
Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its 
positive divisors (including itself). 
Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper 
positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the 
sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 
28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128. -->
